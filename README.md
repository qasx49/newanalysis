New Analysis (Collective)

This is the page for New Analysis. New Analysis is a collective based upon the principle that 'one divides into two".
We are currently based in USA. However, we are universally open to submissions and project proposals. We are interested in analysis of politics, culture, philosophy, and economics, from the proletarian class stand. 

in particular, we hope to produce polemics, educational material, careful social investigation, and commentaries on works both classic and new, in the mlm style.
